### The challenge is creating an endpoint to analyze text. Command to call your API look like this:

I did the API with python3 and flask. You can go [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation) to see how to run a Flask app.

File **test.py** to be used for compare API return results to expected result.

You can modify input and expected results in the file **expected_results.txt**.

I will implement a better test with Travis CI in the future when I have more knowledge about it.
